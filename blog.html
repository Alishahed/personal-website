                    <p>In this blog post, I introduce an app that I built on top of ChatGPT API to help me visualize datasets using natural 
                        language prompts. The article is accompanied by a short video.

                    <h3>Deploying a Streamlit App on Google Cloud Platform: App Engine vs. Cloud Run</h3>
                    <p>Streamlit is an open-source Python library that simplifies the process of creating custom web 
                        applications for data science and machine learning. In this article, we’ll guide you through deploying a 
                        Streamlit app on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using two popular compute services: App Engine and Cloud Run. By the end, 
                        you’ll understand the key differences between the two services and how to deploy a simple Streamlit app to both.

                    <p>If you have followed part 1 of this article, you should have the Streamlit app running locally on your computer. 
                        In this article, we go one step further and describe the steps that you need to take to deploy your
                        app on Streamlit community cloud service and share the app with the public. These are the steps you need to deploy your app:

                    <p>In this series of articles, we learn how to run a simple streamlit data app 
                        locally and deploy the app in streamlit community cloud for everybody to use. 
                        I divided this article into two installments. In part 1, i.e this article, 
                        I describe how to set up your environment to run the European Soccer League 
                        Results App locally. In part 2, I will explain the steps that are needed to 
                        deploy the European Soccer League Results App to Streamlit Community Cloud for the public.

                    <h3>Zelenograd: The Soviet Union’s Ill-fated Attempt to Replicate Silicon Valley</h3>
                    <p>Alfred Sarant and Joel Barr, two covert operatives of the Soviet Union within the Rosenberg spy ring,
                         found themselves entrusted with a mission unlike the typical fare of nuclear espionage. 
                         Their task? The clandestine acquisition of the United States’ most cutting-edge secrets in the realm 
                         of electronics. In 1956, evading the tightening grip of American intelligence, they fled to the USSR, 
                         and within a span of two years, they found themselves presiding over a newly-minted center committed to 
                         propelling the Soviet Union into the forefront of semiconductor technology. Yet, the grand plan was to unravel 
                         before it could truly unfold. They were poised on the precipice of an epic failure. But what factors conspired 
                         to foil their ambitious undertaking?
